//Тask:You will be given an array of strings.

// The first element will be a string containing wagons (numbers). Each number inside the string represents the number of passengers that are currently in a wagon.

// The second element in the array will be the max capacity of each wagon (single number).

// The rest of the elements will be commands in the following format:

// · Add {passengers} – add a wagon to the end with the given number of passengers.

// · {passengers} - find an existing wagon to fit all the passengers (starting from the first wagon)

// At the end, print the final state of the train (all the wagons separated by a space).

//Solution:

function train(arr) {

    
}
train(["32 54 21 12 4 0 23", "75", "Add 10", "Add 0", "30", "10", "75"]);
