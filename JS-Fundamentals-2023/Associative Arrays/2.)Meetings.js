//Task: Write a function that manages meeting appointments. The input comes as an array of strings. Each string contains a weekday and personâ€™s name. For each successful meeting, print a message. If you receive the same weekday twice, the meeting cannot be scheduled so print a conflicting message. In the end, print a list of all successful meetings.

//Solution:

function meetings() {

    
}
meetings(["Monday Peter", "Wednesday Bill", "Monday Tim", "Friday Tim"]);
