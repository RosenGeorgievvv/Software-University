//Task: Write a program, which receives an array of numbers, and condenses them by summing adjacent couples of elements until a single number is obtained.

// Examples

// For example, if we have 3 elements [2, 10, 3], we sum the first two and the second two elements and obtain {2+10, 10+3} = {12, 13}, then we sum again all adjacent elements and obtain {12+13} = {25}.

//Solution:
