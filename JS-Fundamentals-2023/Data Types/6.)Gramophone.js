//Task: Write a function, which as input will receive 3 parameters (strings)

// · The first string is the name of the band

// · The second string is the name of the album

// · The third is holding a song name from the album

// You have to find out how many times the plate will rotate the given song from the album.

// The plate makes a full rotation every 2.5 seconds.

// The song duration in seconds is calculate by the given formula:

// (albumName.length * bandName.length) * song-name.length / 2

// As output, you should print the following message:

// `The plate was rotated {rotations} times.`

// Rotations should be rounded up.

//Solution:

function gramophone(bandName, albumName, songName) {


    


}
gramophone(
