//Task: You are given two integers n and k. Write a JS function that generates and return the following sequence:
// The first element is 1
// Every following element equals the sum of the previous k elements
// The length of the sequence is n elements
// The input comes as two number arguments. The first element represents the number n, and the second â€“ the number k.
// The output is the return value of your function and should be an array of numbers.

//Solution:

function lastKNumbers(n, k){


}
lastKNumbers(6, 3);
