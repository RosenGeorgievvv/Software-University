//Task: Write a function that receives three parameters â€“ an array of pie flavors as strings, two target flavors as strings. The result of the function should be a new array, containing a section of the original array, starting at the first flavor parameter, and ending at (and including) the second flavor parameter.
// The input comes as three arguments:
// An array of strings, representing pie flavours
// Two more strings, representing the start and end of the section, respectively
// The output is the return value of the function and should be an array of strings.
