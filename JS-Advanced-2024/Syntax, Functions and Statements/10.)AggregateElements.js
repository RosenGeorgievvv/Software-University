//Task: Write a program that performs different operations on an array of elements. Implement the following operations:
// •	Sum(ai) - calculates the sum of all elements from the input array
// •	Sum(1/ai) - calculates the sum of the inverse values (1/ai) of all elements from the array
// •	Concat(ai) - concatenates the string representations of all elements from the array
// The input comes as an array of number elements.
// The output should be printed on the console on a new line for each of the operations.
