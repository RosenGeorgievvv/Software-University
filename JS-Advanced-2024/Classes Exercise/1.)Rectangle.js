//Task: Write a class Rectangle for a rectangle object. It needs to have a width (Number), height (Number), and color (String) properties, which are set from the constructor, and a calcArea() method, that calculates and returns the rectangleâ€™s area.


//Solution:


class Rectangle{
    constructor(width, height, color){
        this.width = width;
        this.height = height;
        this.color = color;
    }

    calcArea(){
        return this.height * this.width;
    }
}
let rect = new Rectangle(4, 5, 'Red');
console.log(rect.width);
console.log(rect.height);
console.log(rect.color);
console.log(rect.calcArea());
